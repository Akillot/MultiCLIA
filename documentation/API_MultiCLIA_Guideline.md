# How to use APIs in MultiCLIA

MultiCLIA allows you to use different APIs for various features, but for security reasons,
you must generate your own API keys. Follow these steps to set up each API.

## Getting Started

---

## 1. ChatGPT API (OpenAI)

### Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account
- Visit [OpenAI's Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
- Sign in or create a new account.

### Step 2: Generate an API Key
- Navigate to **API Keys** in your account settings.
- Click **"Create new secret key"**.
- Copy the key immediately, as you wonâ€™t be able to see it again.

### Step 3: Add Funds to Your OpenAI Account
- OpenAI services require payment for token usage.
- Go to the **Billing** section and add funds to your account.

### Step 4: Store the API Key in MultiCLIA
Once you have the API key, store it in the `.env` file inside the cloned MultiCLIA repository:

```sh
cd MultiCLIA
```

```sh
nano .env
```

Then, add the following line:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Save and exit (CTRL + X, then Y, then Enter).

### Step 5: Run MultiCLIA

```sh
/a
```

```sh
/i
```

You should see:

```sh
Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
Max Tokens: 200
Temperature: 0.7
```

If the setup is correct, MultiCLIA will be able to use ChatGPT successfully!

## Notes
- Never share your API keys publicly (e.g., on GitHub). Use a .gitignore file to exclude .env.
- If an API isn't working, double-check that your key is valid and that you've added it correctly to .env
